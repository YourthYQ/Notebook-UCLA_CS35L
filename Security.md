# Security

## Models:
-   a security model (what you're defending)
-   a threat model (who's attacking & how)

## What do you mean by **"security"** **(CIA)**? <br />
-   C: confidentiality (privacy)
-   I: integrity (avoid tampering) 
-   A: availability

### For example: <br />
-   confidentiality: we don't want USC student to have our grade. <br />
-   integrity: we don't want USC student to modify our grade. <br />
-   availiability: USC student just cannot be authorized to get in the system. <br />

### Security Model:
What we need to identify in any security mode: <br />
-   assets (properties, what valueable things we want to protect) <br />
-   vulnerabilities (weakness, identify what is the weak part of your system) <br />
-   threats (plausible ways that attacker may use to attack your vulnerabilities and get your assets) <br />
